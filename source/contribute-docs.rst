Contribute to the documentation
===============================

The documentation is `built with Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ and `hosted on Read the Docs <http://readthedocs.org/projects/scm-backup-docs/>`_.
  
The source code `is here on GitHub <https://github.com/christianspecht/scm-backup-docs/>`_.


Headlines
---------

To make sure that the Read the docs Sphinx theme renders correctly, it's important that `the headline styling is consistent across the whole documentation <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuring.html#how-the-table-of-contents-displays>`_.

SCM Backup's documentation uses these stylings:

- ``=====`` for level 1 *(the top headline of each page)*
- ``-----`` for level 2
- ``+++++`` for level 3
