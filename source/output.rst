Getting SCM Backup's output
===========================

For use cases where SCM Backup is running unattended, there are multiple options to get the output:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   
   output-logging
   output-email

   
Exit code

When the SCM Backup process finishes, it will return exit code ``0`` on success and ``1`` on failure.
