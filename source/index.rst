Welcome to SCM Backup's documentation!
======================================

.. image:: /img/logo128x128.png

SCM Backup is a tool which makes offline backups of your cloud hosted source code repositories, by cloning them.

It will support backing up from multiple source code hosters *(starting with GitHub)* and backing up multiple users/teams per source code hoster.

- `Source code <https://github.com/christianspecht/scm-backup/>`_
- `Website <http://scm-backup.org/>`_
- `Download latest release <http://scm-backup.org/downloads/>`_

It's written in `.NET Core <https://dotnet.github.io/>`_, which means it's supposed to run on Windows, Linux and MacOS.

.. note:: SCM Backup is not finished yet. Proper documentation will come with version 1.0!
